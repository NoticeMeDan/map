\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Requirements}

We have added some more easily understandable requirements to work from which are rooted in the given requirements.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let user upload a map they want to use (OSM format)
  \item Let user save POIs (Point of Interest) with a chosen name
  \item Intuitive way of panning and zooming the map
  \item Let user be able to press on the map and add a visible marker on the location
  \item User is able to get route suggestions with bike, car and walking to and from POIs or arbitrary locations.
  \item Give the user suggestions while typing and after search to give available locations
  \item Possibility of getting written description for navigation between to osmMaterialElements
  \item Make it possible for user to change to colorblind mode
  \item The program must run swift enough so the user doesn't get impatient
  \item User is able to handle zoom easily and get a visible on how much is currently zoomed


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Noun/verb}
The user has a map which they use for finding osmMaterialElements of interest and planning routes between different osmMaterialElements on the map. Usually the user wants to focus on a specific section of the map, and the map is folded to show that area. The map shows various geographical features such as buildings, different types of roads, coastlines etc. These features are displayed with names. The user can see the relative scale on the map such that the user can estimate length of the planned routes. The map is separated into quadrants split by latitude and longitude. A small mini map in the corner is used to orient the user about how the focused area fits into a larger area (e.g. a country). When the user hovers over the map, it displays the nearest address.

\section*{Comments on the Template}
This template provides participants of the first year project with
an idea of how their final report might look like. Please note that the structure
mentioned here is only a suggestion.

\textbf{Of course, you can write your final report in Danish as well. Provide a front-page as described in the project description!}

\section{Introduction} This document reports on the
``visualiziation and routing in Denmark'' project that we developed during the first year project at the IT University of Copenhagen.
In Section~\ref{sec:background} we will provide some background information, talk about details of the dataset and state the requirements of our software product. Next, we will discuss our user interface in Section~\ref{sec:ui}, and reflect on the algorithms that we ended up using in our product in Section~\ref{sec:algorithms}.

In the next sections, we go a bit more into the details of our software. A high-level technical description with accompanying UML diagrams is provided in Section~\ref{sec:technical}. This section is followed by our testing considerations, both from a dynamic and static perspective, in Section~\ref{sec:testing}. We give a quick manual on how to use our software in Section~\ref{sec:manual}.

Finally, we provide a conclusion (Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}) and reflect on our project (Section~\ref{sec:reflection}). In the appendixes, we provide some details with regard to the project work. This includes our group constution, our development diary, and an overview of the changelog between our releases during the semester.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

\section{Graphical User Interface}\label{sec:ui}

Figure~\ref{fig:ui} shows our user interface when running the program on the latest OSM dataset for Denmark. We divided our user interface in the following sections: ... . We chose this approach because ....

\section{Algorithmic Considerations}\label{sec:algorithms}
@Emil --> \\
We were considering using Quadtrees or KDTrees for our data structure. \\
---

We chose to use RadixTree for searching through addresses.

@Simon --> @Magnus --> \\
We chose to use A* for searching through shortest path. We wanted to use A*, because it builds on top of Dijkstra we have been educated in. It functions as an 'informed' Dijkstra, so instead of testing all possible routes, it guesses on the shortest way to the next node and tests.\\
---

In every iteration of the algorithm, it tries to minimize the function determined by a heuristic, that estimates the lenght of the shortest path, together with the distance from the start node to where you currently are in the algorithm.

\section{Testing Considerations}\label{sec:testing}

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \begin{lstlisting}
    @Test
    public void testStreetCityInput() {
        String input = "Rued Langgaards Vej 7, 2500 Valby";
        Address a = Address.parse(input);
        assertEquals("Rued Langgaards Vej", a.street());
        assertEquals("7", a.house());
        assertEquals("2500", a.postcode());
        assertEquals("Valby", a.city());
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Unit test for the Address parser.}
    \label{fig:unittest}
\end{figure}

We used both unit testing and system testing to find errors in our implementations. One unit test we are particularly proud of is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:unittest}.

\section{User Manual}\label{sec:manual}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

\section{Reflection}\label{sec:reflection}
@Simon --> @Magnus --> \\
We spent a lot of time implementing drawing the map in JavaFX. We realised after three weeks, that the solution would take too long to find a good solution, so we switched to Swing. That process was of course unfortunate as a lot of time had been spent on code that didn't end up in the final result. We learned a lot during the process.\\

\subsection{Organisering}

\paragraph{Planning of work}
We meet twice a week to plan work and co-work if need be. We plan who is in charge of what for next time. We have our primary communication channel on Slack.
We start out with a SCRUM-meeting going through what has been made, and what are we going to do next.
We all agree on a relaxed social tone and expect each member to be able to say, if they want more focus and quiet time for working.

If any conflicts should arise we have chosen to use:
Olsen \& Pedersens "grundmodel for konfliktløsning".

We expect to work the hours set aside for it whether at home or on sight. Pauses is controlled by the individuel. If need arises we use pair programming and write it in pull requests.

We expect to use at least 15 hours a week on it pr. person dependant on the individuels experience.

\paragraph{Meeting time}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tuesday: 09:00--16:00
    \item Thursday: 09:00--16:00
\end{itemize}
Magnus and Mathias has special cases on Thursday, as Magnus has to leave at 13, and Mathias some times work from home. \\
Everybody has accepted the above.

\paragraph{Documentation and tools}
We want to document our progress through the process using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Github wiki for log book and meeting minutes: Writing the decisions and considerations in your work.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Generel tools}
We expect to use these programming tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CI (Travis)
    \item SonarQube
    \item Vavr \& Project Lombok
    \item Code Review
\end{itemize}
